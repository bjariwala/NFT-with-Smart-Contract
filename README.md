## Created Art NFT Marketplace with Smart Contract

Created Non-Fungible tokens using ERC1155 standard and deployed on the Ethereum Blockchain. The NFT integrates with the Moralis and renders on the OpenSea testnet Marketplace. 

## ERC1155

This is a ERC-1155 contract integration with the OpenSea marketplace for crypto collectibles. 
We also include:
A script for minting items.
A factory contract for making sell orders for unminted items (allowing for gas-free and mint-free presales).
On top of the features from the OpenSea sample contracts.
ERC1155 supports multiple creators per contract, where only the creator is able to mint more copies
supports pre-minted items for the lootbox to choose from

## ERC-1155 Functions and Features:

Batch Transfer: Transfer multiple assets in a single call.
Batch Balance: Get the balances of multiple assets in a single call.
Batch Approval: Approve all tokens to an address.
EIP-165 Support: Declare supported interfaces.
Hooks: Receive tokens hook.
NFT support: If supply is only 1, treat it as NFT.
Safe Transfer Rules: Set of rules for secure transfer.

## Technologies / Development Platforms

Solidity - Object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts.
Moralis - Moralis is the fastest way to build and deploy dApps on Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Solana, and Elrond (more coming). 
web3.js - Allows users to interact with a local or remote ethereum node using HTTP, IPC or WebSocket.
Remix Ethereum ID - Development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for blockchains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
Rinkeby - Personal blockchain for Ethereum development used to deploy contracts, develop DApps, and run tests.
MetaMask - MetaMask is a software cryptocurrency wallet used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to access their Ethereum wallet through a browser extension or mobile app, which can then be used to interact with decentralized applications.
Opensea - OpenSea is a game-changing decentralized marketplace for buying and selling NFTs. If youâ€™re wondering, NFTs stands for Non-Fungible Tokens, which are unique, collectible digital things like in-game assets, avatars, trading cards, and art.
